## ***Build Tools***
Almost all projects can benefit from automated build processes.  These tools can recompile, compress, concatinate, and redisplay your web app or site, as soon as your code changes are saved.  Some tools integrate these features, while others are task runners which rely on other tools to do the actual dirty work.

## ***Version Control***

If you work on a team of 2 or more, you need version control.  It's even a good idea if you work solo.  There's only one version control system I'd recommended: git.  And definitely use one of the recommended git services, below, as it gives you a free and easy way to backup your work.

#### Highest Recommendation
* [git](http://git-scm.com)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org): great commercial git host
* [GitHub](https://github.com): great open source git host

#### Other Recommended Options
